# metadata_analyzer
This is a **basic project** that provides a tool for extracting metadata from files, currently focusing on images (JPG, JPEG, PNG).  
It is built using the **Factory design pattern**, making it easy to extend to other file types in the future.  
The goal is to serve as a simple starting point for learning and experimenting with metadata extraction in Python.
